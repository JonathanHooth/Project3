## How to Run the Program
---
In order to run the program, you can either download it via zip file or use git clone in the terminal.
If you downloaded from zip, make sure to extract the files to a location where you want to store the program.
Next, using an IDE of your choosing, open the files in the IDE. For this setup, we are using CLion to run the program.
When prompted to set up the project, make sure you select the option to select a CMakeList to build from and select the list that was downloaded.
Once you have chosen the CMakeList to build from, all that is left is to run the application. When running the application, make sure that you are not running main.cpp but instead running the application as a whole.
Have fun messing with graph traversals!
