# Project3

## How to run the program
In order to run the program, you can either download it via zip file or use git clone in the terminal.
If you downloaded from zip, make sure to extract the files to a location where you want to store the program.
Next, using an IDE of your choosing, open the files in the IDE. For this setup, we are using CLion to run the program.
When prompted to set up the project, make sure you select the option to select a CMakeList to build from and select the list that was downloaded.
